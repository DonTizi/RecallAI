## RecallAI {{ date: '2024-01-07T00:00Z' }}

### Introduction
RecallAI is an advanced memory assistant designed to retain all computer activities. It allows users to recall any past activity, such as a search conducted three months ago or the solutions found on specific websites, without the need to save everything manually.

### Capturing Real-Time Activity as Data
RecallAI utilizes a biomimetic approach to mimic human memory by capturing audio-visual data on a computer. This information is transcribed and stored as data, integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for efficient processing.

### Constructing a Rich DataSet
The system converts multimedia input into structured text data. Screenshots and audio are processed and stored in a local SQLITE database, with each item tagged with text transcriptions, date, time, and additional metadata. This creates a detailed, searchable database.

### Towards Semantic Search
RecallAI employs data embedding for Semantic Search, enabling intuitive and context-aware information retrieval. This mirrors natural human recollection, enhancing the efficiency of digital memory recall.
